# Conway's Game of Life

This week you are building the legendary Convway's Game of Life.

https://conwaylife.com/Links to an external site. has a lot of resources for the game of life.

Conway's Game of Life is a cell simulator program that runs trough evolution's and cells react to different rules by showing a state of being alive or dead on a board. 

There are four main rules that each cell follows.

Any live cell with fewer that two live neighbors dies due to under population
 

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies due to overpopulation
 

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors stays unchanged.
 

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will come to life
The following requirements are needed for this project:

Project is buildable with CMake
Project has extensive unit testing
Project files have been divided into meaningful parts, and the logic has been separated from the rest of the program
The size of the game board can be changed
The initial state of the board can be randomized using some patterns.
Code is commented in a way that makes it easy for another person to see what your program does.
Error has been implemented
Before you start programming, your group should have a project in a ticketing system. Think of each step your program should need. Each issue should have a priority, workload estimate.

You can use https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-shareLinks to an external site. to have each consultant collaborating on your code at once.

On Friday each group will present their project in a manner that each consultant understands what the program does at each part.
The presentation will work as a retrospective on the project. What went well, what could need some improvements, what was a major roadblock on the project.
